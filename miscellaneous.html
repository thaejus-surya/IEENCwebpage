        YouTube announced several new audio features on Thursday, some of which
        have already rolled out while others will launch in the coming months.
        Starting today, creators have the ability to enable live auto-captions
        for any livestreams in English to make streams more accessible. This
        feature was previously only available to creators with more than 1,000
        subscribers. <br />
        YouTube plans to expand live auto-captions to all 13 supported
        captioning languages in the coming months. The supported languages
        include Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese,
        Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Vietnamese. <br />
        The company is also currently testing the ability to add multiple audio
        tracks on videos to help provide multi-language audio for international
        audiences along with descriptive audio for people with vision
        impairments. The feature is currently available to a small group of
        creators. YouTube plans to roll out the feature more widely in the
        coming quarters.

        RoboTire raises $7.5M to automate tire replacement
      </h2>

        RoboTire crossed our radar in February of last year, just before much of
        the world was brought to a complete standstill courtesy of the pandemic.
        Things were still fairly early stages for the Detroit-based startup,
        which was founded by former Spark Robotics CEO Victor Darolfi. <br />
        The company has clearly picked up some good, strategic interest in the
        intervening year and a half, as more and more industries are looking to
        embrace the benefits of automation. Today it announced that it has
        raised a $7.5 million Series A round, led by The Reinalt-Thomas
        Corporation, the major tire retail brand behind Discount Tire and
        America’s Tire. The latter, funnily enough, got a bit of a mixed
        shout-out when we spoke to Darolfi last year.

        Microsoft acquires Ally.io, OKR startup that raised $76 million

        Microsoft announced today that it has acquired Ally.io, a software
        service that helps companies measure their progress against OKRs
        (objectives and key results), a common way the management measures both
        individual and company progress. The two firms did not share the
        purchase price. <br />
        Microsoft plans to incorporate Ally into its Viva family of employee
        experience products. Microsoft says the idea behind Viva and the Ally
        acquisition is to provide a more transparent way to communicate company
        goals and objectives to employees
